    <!-- Normally we don't put scripts in the head because they load before the body
    This causes issues trying to acces objects that have not yet be rendered
    Adding scripts to the bottom of the body can be difficult to work with
    So "defer" and "async" were introducted. By using defer it will wait to 
    load the script until after the body is loaded -->
    <script src="script.js" async defer></script>
